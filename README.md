## How to play
Hello players and welcome to Unknown Space.<br>
As you'll quickly discover the controls are simple, but the game is not.<br>
You'll need to use your mouse to navigate from planet to planet while avoiding crashing in the asteroids.<br>
So as I  said the controls are simple you move your mouse to aim and hold the left mouse button to launch your starship.<br>
Your goal is to go from the bottom left planet to the top right planet.<br>
All of this while being timed, so you'll need to be quick.<br>
At the end of the game (if you reach the end) you'll be given your time on the left of the end game screen.<br>
